# color-generator

This was a really fun project for me as this was the first time I was able to implement my knowledge on APIs.
Just as a recap of what I have learned just with this project:

    -Promises
    -.then() and chaining
    -and although I didn't get to implement this I did learn how to fetch API data with async/await
